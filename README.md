# Awesome WebHID [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of resources relating to the WebHID (Human Interface Device) API

WebHID is a browser API (`navigator.hid`) that provides access to HID input/output devices. It's a higher level of abstraction than the WebUSB and Web Bluetooth APIs, but lower than the Gamepad API and basic input (pointer/keyboard).

## Status
Always up to date information - [Chrome Platform Status: WebHID](https://chromestatus.com/features/5172464636133376)

As of 19 September 2019:
* Available [behind a flag](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=890096#c38) in version 78.
  * Version 78 is currently [in beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta)
* Origin trials expected in version 80 (estimated stable early 2020).
* Release expected in version 83.


## Good to know
* WebHID is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track<sup>[(ref)](https://wicg.github.io/webhid)</sup>.
* Devices that generate trusted input (e.g. keyboards, mice, security keys) will not be accessible. Such devices define their reports in [top-level HID collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/top-level-collections) that will be considered protected usages<sup>[(ref1)](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/OaDCpCaEe_4/uZ0z7frlAAAJ]), [(ref2)](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/human-interface-device-hid-api/3070/6])</sup>.
* Access to a device must be granted by the user via a chooser dialog provided by the browser, similarly to WebUSB and Web Bluetooth. Launching the chooser must be done from the context of a user gesture (e.g. a mouse click).
* Neither the WebUSB<sup>[(ref)](https://github.com/WICG/webusb/issues/29)</sup> or Web Bluetooth<sup>[(ref)](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues/393)</sup> APIs allow access to HID-class devices.

## Talks & videos
None yet.


## Devices
*Devices that work well with WebHID, and device-specific abstraction libraries. Do also file an issue to inform others of devices that don't. Not all devices in the USB HID device class will communicate using the high-level abstractions.*
